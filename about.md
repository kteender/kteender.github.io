# ABOUT

Hi, I'm Katie. I'm a CG technical director in Los Angeles. For work, I do tools development and CG generalist work on the Avatar sequels. I recently received my first film credit for working on Avatar: The Way of Water. Outside of work, I write code for use on my personal and freelance animation projects. 

I have scripting and content-creation experience in a variety of DCCs including Maya, Motionbuilder, the Adobe Suite, and Blender. I have worked in virtual production and game engine workflows. I also have traditional art training. I can code in Python, HTML, and CSS. I am comfortable working with git. 

I made this site to showcase my work and share knowledge with other CG artists and developers. The site is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted by <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.

If you want to get to know me a little better, you can check out the <a href="/loved-list.html">loved list</a> section, which is my off-topic rant pile. E-stalk me @kteender on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kteender/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kteender">Github</a>.

If you have a resume request, freelance proposal, or technical question, please contact me at contact@ktcg.art.
