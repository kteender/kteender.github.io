Hello! This is the second workflow breakdown for my thesis film. It will concern the motion capture animation process. Check out the first post about using Unity to make a short film here, and watch the film itself here.

Purpose: This post is designed for students or independent artists considering using motion capture for animated filmmaking, and would like an example of how I approached the process. For the sake of length, I will not be going into tutorial-level detail on the different MotionBuilder/Maya tools referred to, but I will post link to technical information as it comes up.
