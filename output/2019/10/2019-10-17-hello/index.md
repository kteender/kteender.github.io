Hi! My name is Katie Tender, and I love CG art.

I make a lot of 3D animation. I specialize in character animation and rigging, but in the past year and a half, I've become increasingly interested in figuring out alternative workflows or ways of using industry-standard software in unexpected ways to make projects that would otherwise be out of scope. From a technical perspective, most of my projects seek to find ways to speed up the model - texture - rig - layout - animate - render - composite pipeline. This is how I got into motion capture -- it seemed like a faster alternative to character animation (which it is, once you know how to do it, but has its own trade offs...). Anyway, in the past, I've developed a workflow around animating with flat planes, and currently, and integrated Unity into a film workflow for effects and rendering. Right now, I'm working on a side project using Blender's compositor to approximate the "Corporate Memphis" art style.
